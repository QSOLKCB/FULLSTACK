# 🧠💻 FREE FULL STACK!!!

**Turning everyone into a Full Stack Developer — one MEME-Stack at a time.**  
Because you shouldn’t need a 14-course bootcamp to install Python, Node, or sanity.

## 🚀 What Is This?

`FULLSTACK` is a **bash-driven setup framework** that installs and configures a *complete full-stack development environment* — front-end, back-end, AI, DSP, and cosmic nonsense — on a clean **Arch Linux** system (or derivative).

Think of it as:

- 🪄 `pacman` + `pip` + `npm` + caffeine = instant workstation  
- 🤖 One script to rule them all  
- 🧙‍♂️ A developer meme that actually works

## 🧩 Includes

| Layer | Description | Tools |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| 🎨 **Frontend** | Build pretty things, or ugly ones ironically. | `nodejs`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `vite`, `react`, `tailwindcss` |
| ⚙️ **Backend** | Bash meets Python meets chaos. | `python`, `flask`, `fastapi`, `sqlite`, `postgresql`, `redis` |
| 🧠 **AI / DSP** | Pretend you’re doing deep learning. Actually make noise. | `torch`, `tensorflow`, `librosa`, `openai`, `pyaudio` |
| 🔊 **Audio / Synth** | Because coding *isn’t real* unless it clips. | `pipewire`, `ardour`, `carla`, `easyeffects` |
| 🧮 **Science Stack** | For when memes evolve into theses. | `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `jupyterlab`, `texlive` |
| 🧰 **Dev Tools** | The good stuff. | `git`, `neovim`, `zsh`, `htop`, `btop`, `docker`, `podman` |

Each layer can be toggled interactively.  
No vendor lock-in, no cloud FOMO — just **pure open-source chaos**.

## 🧙 How to Install

> **⚠️ Warning:** Running this script gives you *superpowers*.  
> It may also fill your drive with gigabytes of "essential" developer tools.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QSOLKCB/FULLSTACK.git
cd FULLSTACK
chmod +x fullstack.sh
./fullstack.sh
Everything is logged in ~/fullstack_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.log for easy rollback and bragging rights.

🧰 What It Does (in Plain English)
Checks system sanity (internet, sudo, brain).

Installs stacks (audio, science, webdev, AI, etc.).

Configures defaults — sets PATHs, virtualenvs, aliases.

Logs everything (for science).

Finishes cleanly (or gracefully explodes with an error message you can meme).

🧩 Optional Flags
Flag	Description
--lite	Skips heavy tools like Blender or TensorFlow.
--no-audio	Disables audio setup for headless servers.
--no-ai	Keeps it human.
--memestack	Installs everything including chaos (default).

Example:

bash
Copy code
./fullstack.sh --lite
🧠 Philosophy
Full-stack isn’t just a skillset — it’s a state of being.
When your shell, synth, and psyche are all in sync, you are the stack.

This project continues the QSOL-IMC mission:

Truth compiled. Small is beautiful. Fast is holy. Transparent by design.
